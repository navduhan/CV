As an experienced bioinformatics and computational biology professional, I have a proven track record of combining biology and big data analytics to support organismal enhancement and genomics-enabled research. My expertise includes analyzing high throughput data from Next-generation sequencing and developing machine learning-based models for predicting abiotic stress, resistant genes, subcellular localization, and other biological problems. I also excel in developing host-pathogen interaction models and maintaining workflows, tools, web servers, and databases for analysis and data mining.
