\hfill\par
To achieve my research goals in \textbf{Biological Foundations of One Health} theme, I intend to follow a multidisciplinary research strategy combining computational and molecular biology. 
My interests are divided into the following categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item Integrating multi-omics data to improve  animal, plant and human health / response to environmental changes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis: Genome assembly, RNA-seq, ChiP-seq, Single Cell RNA-seq, Var-seq, Digenome, metagenomes \textit{etc}.
\item Genome-scale functional annotation: develop novel algorithms to predict biochemical pathways and structure/function analyses
\item Development of new pipelines, tools and improvement for existing pipelines for NGS data analysis
\end{itemize}
\item Artifical Intelligence (Machine Learning) based computational modeling to analyze large-scale sequence data
\item System biology (\textit{integrating phenotypic, genotypic, and environmental data}):
\begin{itemize}
\item Host-pathogen interactions
\item Protein-protein interactions: both at intra- and inter-species level
\item Metabolic pathway analysis, gene regulatory networks
\end{itemize}
\item Develop prediction tools / web servers / databases to aid research community in the above areas of interest.

\end{itemize}
